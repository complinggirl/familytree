== README


This is an implementation of a family tree in Rails assignment for SDLearn. This includes the extra credit portion which uses a recursive method for finding ancestors and includes the corresponding spec. I don't often get to write methods of this type so it was actually a treat. 

There is no user interface for this program. It was designed to demonstrate the use of rspec. To use, clone to desktop, 

$rake db:create
$rake db:migrate
$ rspec person_spec
